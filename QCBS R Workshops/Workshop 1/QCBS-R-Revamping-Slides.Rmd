# Introduction
## What is R?
<div id = left>
R is an open source programming language designed for statistical analysis, data mining, and data visualization.
</div>

## Why use R?
<div id = left>
**It's open source**
 - Improved by the public, for the public!
 - Free
 </div>

<img style="float: right; width: 200px;" src="images/Opensource.svg">

<div id = right>
**It's compatible**
R works on most existing operating systems
</div>

<images linux, mac, windows>

## Why use R?
<image Analyzing data with R>
R allows you to do everything with one program, which is nice!

## Why use R?
<img style="float: left; width: 200px;" src="nomdelimage">
 - More and more scientists use it every year!
 - Increasing capacities

## Challenge 1
<img rubicub.png>
Open Rstudio
![](Rstudio.png){width=50%, }

## The Rstudio console
<img>

## Note for Windows user
If the restriction:"unable to write on disk" appears when you try to open R-Studio, right-click on your R-Studio icon and chose:"Execute as administrator" to open the program.

## How to read the console
Text in the console typically looks like this:
```{r, include = FALSE}
output <- "This is the output"
```

```{r}
output
```

## How to read the console

<div id = "left">

```{r}
output
```

</div>

<div id = "right">
 - You always have to push "enter" for the input to run in the console.
</div>

<put an arrow here>
What does this bracket in the output means?

## How to read the console

```{r}
output
```
<put an arrow here>
This bracket help you to locate "where" you are in the output

```{r, echo = FALSE}
		c(1:20)
```

# Using R as a calculator

## Addition, substraction, etc.

- Additions and Substractions

```{r}
	1+1
  10-1
```

- Multiplications and Divisions

```{r]
	2*2
  8/2
```

- Exponents

```{r}
	2^3
```

## Challenge 2

Use R to calculate the following skill testing question:

$$
2+16*24-56
$$

<small>Hints: The `*` symbol is used to multiply</small>

## Challenge 2: Solution

## Challenge 2: Solution

- Question

$$
2+16*24-56
$$

- Solution

```{r}
	2+16*24-56
```

## Challenge 3

Use R to calculate the following skill testing question:

$$
2+16*24-56 / (2+1)-457
$$

<small>Hints: Think about the order of the operation.</small>

## Challenge 3: Solution

- Question

$$
2+16*24-56 / (2+1)-457
$$

- Solution

```{r}
	2+16*24-56/(2+1)-457
```

Note that R follows the order of the operations

## R command line tip

Use the "Up" and "Down" arrow keys to reproduce previous commands.

Give it a try!

## Challenge 4

<div id="right">


```{r echo = F, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
  radius <- 1
  theta <- seq(0, 2*pi, length = 200)
	plot(c(-1, 1), c(-1, 1), type = "n", ann = F, axes = F, asp = 1)
	lines(x = radius * cos(theta), y = radius * sin(theta))
	arrows(0, 0, x1 = 1, length = 0)
	text(.5, .1, "radius = 5 cm", cex = .8)
```

</div>

<div id="left">

What is the area of this circle, with a radius of $5\ cm$?

</div>

## Challenge 4: Solution

- Question

What is the area of a circle, with a radius of $5\ cm$?

- Solution

```{r}
  3.1416*5^2
```

Tip: Note that `R` has some built-in constant such as $\pi$, so you can write:

```{r}
  pi*5^2
```

# Objects

## Objects

- One of the most useful concept in `R`!
- You can store values as named objects using the assignement operator `<-`

```{r, eval = F}
  object name <- assigned value
```

The value on the **right** is assigned to the name on the **left** with the assignement operator `<-`

 <small>It is also possible to use the `=` sign, but it is better to **avoid it** as it is also used for other purposes.</small>

## Objects names

- Objects names can only include:

|  Type      |  Symbol |
|------------|--------:|
| Letters    | a-z A-Z |
| Numbers    |     0-9 |
| Period     |       . |
| Underscore |       _ |

- Objects names should **always** begin with a letter.
- `R` is **case sensitive**, the names `Data1` and `data1` are not the same.

## Object names: good practices

- Try having short and explicit names for your variables. Naming a variable `var`  is not very informative.
- Adding spaces after and before the `<-` is recommended because it adds clarity.
- When typing the object's name, `R` return its value.

```{r}
  mean.x <- (2+6)/2
  mean.x
```

## Challenge 5

Create an object with a value of $1+1.718282$ (Euler's number) and name it `euler.value`.

## Challenge 5: Solution

- Question

Create an object with a value of $1+1.718282$ (Euler's number) and name it `euler.value`.

- Solution

```{r}
  euler.value <- 1+1.718282
  euler.value
```

## Challenge 6

Create a second object (you decide the name) with a name that starts with a number. What happens?

## Challenge 6: Solution

- Question

Create a second object (you decide the name) with a name that starts with a number. What happens?

- Solution

Creating an object name that starts with a number returns the following error:

```{r, eval = F}
 Error: unexpected symbol in "[your object name]"
```

## R command line tip

- Use the tab key to autocomplete scripts
- This helps avoid spelling errors and speeds up command entering

Let's try it!

## R command line tip

- Enter `eu`
- Push tab
- Use the arrow keys and push enter to select the correct autocomplete

# Types of data structures in R

## Types of data structures in R

- Vectors
- Data frames
- Matrices, arrays and lists

## Vectors

- An entity consisting of a list of related values
- A single value is called an *atomic value*
- All values of a vector must have the **same mode** (or class).
      * Numeric: only numbers
      * Logical: True/False entries
      * Character: Text, or a mix of text and other modes

## Vectors

- Creating vectors usually require the `c` function

<small>`c` stands for *combine* or *concatenate*.</small>

- The syntax is:

```{r, eval = F}
  vector <- c(value1, value2, ...)
```

## Vectors

- Numeric vectors

```{r}
  num.vector <- c(1, 4, 3, 98, 32, -76, -4)
  num.vector
```

- Character vectors

```{r}
  char.vector <- c("blue", "red", "green")
  char.vector
```

## Vectors

- Logical vectors

```{r}
 bool.vector<- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
 bool.vector
 # You can just write T for TRUE and F for FALSE, it's exactly the same
 bool.vector2 <- c(T, T, F)
 bool.vector2
```

## Challenge 7

Create a vector containing the first 5 odd numbers, starting from 1, and name it `odd.n`

## Challenge 7: Solution

- Question

Create a vector containing the first 5 odd numbers, starting from 1, and name it `odd.n`

- Solution

```{r}
 odd.n <- c(1,3,5,7)
```

## Vectors

We can use vectors for calculations

```{r}
  x <- c(1:5)
  y <- 6
```

<small>The semicolon symbol `:` is use to combine all values between the first and the second provided numbers. `c(1:5)` returns `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`</small>

```{r}
  x+y
  x*y
```

## Data Frames

- Used to store data tables
- A list of vectors of the same length
- Columns = variables
- Rows = observations, sites, cases, replicates, ...
- Differents columns can have different modes

## Data Frames

Let's say you want to store this table in `R`:

|ID of the site|soil pH|# of species|treatment|
|---|---|---|---|
|A1.01|5.6|17|Fert|
|A1.02|7.3|23|Fert|
|B1.01|4.1|15|No Fert|
|B1.02|6.0|7|No Fert|

## Data Frames

One way of doing it is:
- Start by creating vectors

```{r}
  siteID <- c("A1.01", "A1.02", "B1.01", "B1.02")
  soil_pH <- c(5.6, 7.3, 4.1, 6.0)
  num.sp <- c(17, 23, 15, 7)
  treatment <- c("Fert", "Fert", "No_fert", "No_fert")
```

- We then combine them using the function `data.frame`

```{r}
  my.first.df <- data.frame(siteID, soil_pH, num.sp, treatment)
```

<small>We will come back to the `data.frame` function later.</small>

## Data Frames

```{r}
  my.first.df
```

## Matrices, Arrays and Lists
