## Control flow

Program flow control can be simply defined as the order in which a program is executed

### Why is it advantageous to have structured programs?

- It decreases the complexity and time of the task at hand
- This logical structure also means that the code has increased clarity
- It also means that many programmers can work on one program.

**This means increased productivity**

## Codes solutions

Flow charts can be used to plan programs, and represent structure
